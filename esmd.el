;;; Commentary: Major mode to use VMD within emacs. 
;;;             It is derived from tcl mode but allow to run an instance of VMD in a
;;;             second buffer in order to send on-the-fly the commands. It add to tcl-mode tree
;;;             keys to directly interact with VMD:
;;;             "\C-c\C-n" vmd-send-line
;;;             "\C-c\C-r" vmd-send-region
;;;             "\C-c\C-q" vmd-send-abort
;;;             USAGE:
;;;             
;;;             1. installation:
;;;             add to your .emacs file
;;;             (load "<path>/esmd.el")
;;;             you might want to add the lines
;;;             (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.vmd\\'" . vmd-mode))
;;;             (autoload 'vmd-mode "vmd" "Major mode for VMD." t)
;;;             any file with the extension .vmd should be recognised. You can call
;;;             the mode manually by "M-x vmd-mode";
;;;
;;;             2. run VMD within emacs use "M-x vmd-run";
;;;             
;;;             3. start working.
